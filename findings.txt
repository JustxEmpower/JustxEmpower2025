Key Findings from Screenshots:

Screenshot 1 (5.30.41PM) - EDITOR MODE (Preview button NOT highlighted):
- Shows "The Philosophy" section with image on the right
- The image of mountains/sunset has SHARP corners (no rounded edges)
- The section shows "OUR APPROACH" label, "The Philosophy" title
- Image appears to be a je-section-standard block

Screenshot 2 (5.30.37PM) - EDITOR MODE (block is selected, has + button below):
- Shows the same page but with a block selected (has the + button below the hero)
- The "The Philosophy" section image ALSO has SHARP corners
- Both screenshots are in EDITOR mode (not preview mode)

CONCLUSION:
The issue is NOT editor vs preview mode. The issue is that the JESectionRenderer 
is NOT applying rounded corners to the image in EITHER mode.

Looking at the code, the JESectionRenderer should apply:
- borderRadius: content.imageBorderRadius || '2rem'

But in the screenshots, the image clearly has sharp corners.

This suggests either:
1. The block content doesn't have imageBorderRadius set
2. The CSS is being overridden somewhere
3. The block type being used is different from je-section-standard
