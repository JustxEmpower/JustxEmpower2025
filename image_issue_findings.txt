KEY FINDING FROM SCREENSHOT (18-50-30):

Looking at the JE Section Standard block ("The Philosophy" section):
- The mountain/sunset image on the right side has SHARP CORNERS - NOT ROUNDED!
- The image clearly shows 90-degree corners, not the expected 2rem rounded corners

This confirms the user's issue - the rounded corners are NOT being applied to the image.

The code at line 927-958 in JESectionRenderer.tsx shows:
- borderRadius: content.imageBorderRadius || '2rem' should be applied
- But the image is displaying with sharp corners

POSSIBLE CAUSES:
1. The CSS is being overridden somewhere
2. The inline style is not being applied correctly
3. There's a parent element stripping the border-radius
4. The overflow:hidden is missing on the container

NEXT STEP: Inspect the actual DOM to see what styles are being applied
